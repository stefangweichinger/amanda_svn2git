# sample Amanda2 disklist file, derived from CS.UMD.EDU's disklist
#
# If your configuration is called, say, "csd2", then this file normally goes
# in /etc/amanda/csd2/disklist.
#
# File format is:
#
#	hostname diskdev dumptype [spindle [interface]]
#
# where the dumptypes are defined by you in amanda.conf or in-line.

# At our site, root partitions have a different dumptype because they
# are of lower priority; they don't contain user data, and don't change
# much from the department prototype.  In a crunch, they can be left for
# last or skipped.

# A SPARCstation 1+
