# CAStor changer definition; based on S3 changer.
#
# Parameter "tpchanger":
#   Replace <BUCKET> and <PREFIX> with your own values.
#   Configure as many slots as tape cycles ("tapecycle").
#
# Device properties:
#   STORAGE_API -- Set to "CASTOR" to use the CAStor storage back-end.
#
#   S3_HOST -- The DNS round-robin name or name/IP or a cluster node that will
#   be used as the primary access node (PAN). An optional ":{port}" suffix can
#   be included if necessary.
#
#   S3_SSL -- Set to "YES" or "NO" to control the use of SSL when communicating
#   with the cluster. Your storage cluster must have an SSL front-end
#   configured in order to use SSL from the client. SSL implies port 443.
#
#   TENANT_NAME -- The name of the storage tenant domain within the CAStor
#   cluster. This parameter is optional and S3_HOST will be used as the tenant
#   domain if this paramter is not set.
#
#   USERNAME and PASSWORD -- These are the login credentials for the storage
#   operations. These must be defined even if their values are not used.
#
#   REPS -- This controls the number of replicas for data objects when using
#   the CAStor storage back-end. This value is substituted directly into the
#   content header: "lifepoint: [] reps=%s". The default is "2".
#
#   REPS_BUCKET -- This controls the number of replicas for an automatically
#   created bucket when using the CAStor storage back-end. The default is "4".
#
#   CREATE_BUCKET -- Set to "YES" to automatically create the bucket if it
#   does not exist. Set to "NO" to prevent this.
