# vim:ft=automake

# A rule to make precompiler output from C files.  This is not used during
# ordinary builds, but but can very useful in debugging problems on strange
# architectures.  With this rule, we can ask users to 'make foo.i' and send
# the result to us.
#
# It touches some automake internals ($COMPILE), but since it's not
# build-critical, that's OK.
