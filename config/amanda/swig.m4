# OVERVIEW
#
#   Set up for building SWIG bindings.  Note that shipped tarballs contain pre-built
#   SWIG bindings, so there should be no need for SWIG on non-developer machines.
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   Find perl and SWIG, and substitute PERL_INC, the -I command that will lead the compiler
#   to perl.h and friends.
#
#   Supports --with-perlextlibs, for adding extra LIBS declarations to perl extensions.

	    # Before 7.0, FreeBSD systems don't include a DT_NEEDS segment in
	    # libgthread to automatically pull in the desired threading library.
	    # Instead, they assume that any application linking against
	    # libgthread will pull in the threading library.  This is fine for
	    # Amanda C applications, but for Perl applications this assumption
	    # means that the perl binary would pull in the threading library.
	    # But perl is compiled without threading by default.  
	    #
	    # Specifically, this occurs on any FreeBSD using gcc-3.*: the linking
	    # decision is made in gcc's spec files, which were changed in
	    # gcc-4.0.  For a more in-depth discussion, see
	    #  http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Installation/OS_Specific_Notes/Installing_Amanda_on_FreeBSD
	    #
	    # The easiest solution for the "default" case is to link all perl
	    # extension libraries against the threading library, so it is loaded
	    # when perl loads the extension library.  The default threading
	    # library in FreeBSD is libpthread.  The below default will work on
	    # such a FreeBSD system, but ports maintainers and those with
	    # different configurations may need to override this value with
	    # --with-perlextlibs.
	    #
	    # We can't use -pthread because gcc on FreeBSD ignores -pthread in
	    # combination with -shared.  See
	    #   http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2006-June/026229.html
