This directory contains scripts and data files necessary to build various binary
(or source) installation packages.  These are the currently functional packages:
	-.deb packages
	-RPMs for various OSes that use them.  TODO: Wiki page with a full
	 list of RPM using distros and versions the .spec supports.
Coming soon:
	-ebuilds for Gentoo
	-.msi packages for Windows XP and Server 2003 
	-macosx-pkg builds
	-Solaris .pkg builds for 9,10
	-Common files which can be shared by all packages such License.txt,
	 README, or Copyrights.

The Directory layout is as follows:
packaging/
	deb/		# Debian
	rpm/		# RPM

Each subdirectory (except common) has a shell script named buildpkg.  This 
script will actually build the package with Zmanda's defaults for you.

Notes:
    -deb package changelog is non-standard when checked out.  either use 
     packaging/deb/buildpkg to build the package, or replace %%VERSION%% with
     the correct number supplied in configure.ac at approximately line 10:
     AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( ... )

See http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/Installation for more information.
