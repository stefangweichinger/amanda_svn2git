Protocol) is an open protocol for network based backup enabling
multi-vendor backup solutions. NDMJOB may be used as a ready-to-run

1-Mar-2000   NDMJOBLIB:1.1 Release

Howdy NDMP Folx,

A PRE-CONNECTATHON drop of NDMJOB is available. Please see

	http://www.traakan.com/ndmjob/

This is NDMJOBLIB version is 1.1.

There has been a fair bit of shake-out. Many bugs
are fixed. There will be more shake-out before
Connectathon. It really is in pretty good shape.

Most of the NDMPv3 work is done. What's missing is the
ability to provide a name list (nlist[]) to the RECOVER
and RECOVER_FILEHIST. This needs to be discussed
because the ndmp3_name is a bit awkward for the
tar(1) format. Also, ndmjob -x hasn't been tried
and probably won't work.

It does to direct and sequential recover of the image
stream. There are lots and lots of DATA_READ messages
passed around if you enable them with -E RECOVER_DIRECT=yes.

The MD5 stuff isn't integrated, but will be by Connectathon.
It looks pretty good, and won't take much time.

There are template files ndmos_xxx.h and ndmos_xxx.c for the
O/S specific portions. ndmos_freebsd.[ch] and ndmos_solaris.[ch]
are here, and use the tape simulator. No SCSI support. If you
make a new ndmos_xxx.[ch], or fix the ones already here, please
be a good sport and contribute them back.

There is a new file in the source directory called
ThingsToTry. This represents what Traakan will try
with NDMJOB as a CONTROL agent (client) at Connectathon.

Please send comments, questions, bug reports to ndmp-tech@ndmp.org.
Please send contributions, like ndmos_xxx.[ch] and bug fixes, to
ndmjob@traakan.com.

Regards,
	-gww




PLANNED DROPS
=============

1.2 Connectathon, Mar-2-2000. Improved tests. Integration
    of contributions and bug fixes. While at Connectathon,
    NDMJOB will be adapted real-time to reflect consensus.

1.3 Post Connectathon. Week of Mar-13-2000. Changes at
    Connectathon integrated.

18-Feb-2000   NDMJOBLIB:1.0 Release


Howdy NDMP Folx,

A PREVIEW drop of NDMJOB is available. Please see

	http://www.traakan.com/ndmjob/

This is the PREVIEW drop of NDMJOB. The NDMJOBLIB version is 1.0.

The NDMPv3 work isn't quite finished. It's close. It's taking
more than I expected. The Makefile here disables the NDMPv3
features. You can re-enable them. It does compile, and some
things work.

There are template files ndmos_xxx.h and ndmos_xxx.c for the
O/S specific portions. ndmos_freebsd.[ch] and ndmos_solaris.[ch]
are here, and use the tape simulator. No SCSI support. If you
make a new ndmos_xxx.[ch], or fix the ones already here, please
be a good sport and contribute them back.

It's been quite a while and a few hundred changes since I've
put NDMJOB through it's paces. Bugs and quirks are likely.

Please send comments, questions, bug reports to ndmp-tech@ndmp.org.
Please send contributions, like ndmos_xxx.[ch] and bug fixes, to
ndmjob@traakan.com.

Regards,
	-gww
