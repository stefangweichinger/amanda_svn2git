I. Installation Steps


1. cfggsc, defgsc, ucfggsc, gsc.cat go into /usr/lib/methods
2. gscdd goes into /usr/lib/drivers
3. As root, do:

	odmadd gsc.add

II. Configuration Steps

	mkdev -c generic -s scsi -t gsc -pscsiN -wT,L

where N is the Nth scsi bus, T is target, L is lun.

This should create a /dev/gscM for this device.

You can use tstinq to run a test inquiry command.
Use lsdev -C to see what gets configured.

III. Removal steps

1. Do
	rmdev -d -l gscM

for M = 0..M-1 to remove and undefine all gsc devices.

2. Do, as root,

	odmdelete -o PdDv -q uniquetype=generic/scsi/gsc

3. Remove files installed in I. above.
