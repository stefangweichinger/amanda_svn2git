 * Dump output lines are scanned for two types of regex matches.
 *
 * First, there are some cases, unfortunately, where dump detects an
 * error but does not return an error code.  We would like to bring these
 * errors to the attention of the operators anyway.  
 *
 * Second, we attempt to determine what dump thinks its output size is.
 * This is cheaper than putting a filter between dump and compress just
 * to determine the output size.  The re_size table contains regexes to
 * match the size output by various vendors' dump programs.  Some vendors
 * output the number in Kbytes, some in 512-byte blocks.  Whenever an
 * entry in re_size matches, the first integer in the dump line is
 * multiplied by the scale field to get the dump size.
