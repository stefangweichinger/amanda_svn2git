<refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The <emphasis remap='I'>tapelist</emphasis> file contains the list of
tapes in active use.  This file is not ordinarily edited or examined
manually.  Its format may change, or it may be removed altogether, in future
versions of Amanda.  It contains lines of the form:</para>

<para><programlisting>
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS label flags [BARCODE:barcode] [META:meta] [BLOCKSIZE:blocksize] [POOL:pool] [STORAGE:storage] [CONFIG:config] [#comment]
</programlisting></para>

<para>Where
<emphasis remap='I'>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</emphasis>
is the time the tape was written,
<emphasis remap='I'>label</emphasis>
is a label for the tape as written by
<emphasis remap='B'>amlabel</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='I'>flags</emphasis>
is one of "reuse" or "no-reuse" and tells Amanda whether the tape may be reused.
A non-reusable tape will not be overwritten, even if it is older than <emphasis
remap='B'>dumpcycle</emphasis> dumps.  See the
<emphasis remap='B'>reuse</emphasis>
options of
<manref name="amadmin" vol="8"/>.</para>
<para>The optional barcode is prefixed with 'BARCODE' if the volume have a barcode.</para>
<para>The optional meta label is prefixed with 'META' if the volume is on a meta volume.</para>
<para>The optional blocksize is prefixed with 'BLOCKSIZE'.</para>
<para>The optional pool is prefixed with 'POOL', it is the name of the tape-pool.</para>
<para>The optional storage is prefixed with 'STORAGE', it is the name of the storage.</para>
<para>The optional config is prefixed with 'CONFIG', it is name of the config that</para>
<para>is using that volume. This is useful to share the tapelist across multiple
config.</para>
<para>The optional comment is prefixed with a '#' and continues to the end of
the line.</para>
<para>Amanda will maintain this comment until the tape is overwritten.  Note that
comments are not allowed on blank lines.</para>

<para>An entry without POOL is in the tape-pool with the name of config running name.</para>
<para>A new labelled volume have a timestamp of "0" and have no STORAGE and CONFIG.</para>
<para>A used volume with timestamp != "0" without STORAGE is in the storage with the name of the running config</para>
<para>A used volume with timestamp != "0" without CONFIG is in the running config.</para>

<para>It is possible to share the same tapelist across multiple config If the POOL, STORAGE and CONFIG are correctly set.</para>
<para>The file is sorted such that the most-recently used tape appears on the first line, and the oldest tape appears on the last line.</para>

<para><emphasis remap='B'>Amdump</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='B'>amflush</emphasis>
will by default refuse to write to an unlabeled tape, or to a labeled tape that
is considered active or marked "no-reuse".  There must be more tapes in active
rotation (see the
<emphasis remap='B'>tapecycle</emphasis>
option) than there are runs in the backup cycle (see the
<emphasis remap='B'>dumpcycle</emphasis>
option) to prevent overwriting a backup image that would be needed to do a full recovery.</para>
